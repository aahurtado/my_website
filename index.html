                    <p>
                        From the fall of 2013 to the spring of 2017 I attended the University of California, San Diego where I
                        learned to program and the marvelous art of Software Engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time at UCSD, I learned everything from object-oriented programming and software design patterns to data structures and algorithms. I did the majority of my class work in Java, C++, and Python which are my main languages. During my time as a student I also worked as a tutor for the UCSD CSE department for several quarters. I tutored both lower and upper division data structure courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A huge part of my time at UCSD was being accepted into the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) by the CSE department. I applied to the program the first year it was created and was one of 23 undergraduate students accepted into the program. The main purpose of the program was to expose and get undergraduate students involved in Computer Science Research which is typically done by graduate students and professors. As a result of the ERSP program, I spent three years working alongside graduate students and professors on their research projects in the <a href="https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/" target="_blank">Systems and Networking Research Group</a>. You can read more about the program <a href="https://ersp.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>.

I was a full-time software engineer and was later promoted to be a senior software engineer for excellent programming, engineering, and collaboration performance. I was a primary member of the backend healthcare analytics engine team that developed and certified measures (including HEDIS, AMP, CMS, Risk Adjustment, and custom) for a large-scale production system that generated alerts for 10 million members daily.

                <h5>What are <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEDIS</a> measures?</h5>
                <p>
                    HEDIS measures are a set of standardized metrics used to evaluate the quality of healthcare services. They are used by healthcare organizations to monitor and improve the quality of care they provide. It's a gold standard in healthcare performance measurement, used by over 90% of health plans in the US.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HEDIS measures are created and managed by the <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Committee for Quality Assurance</a> (NCQA). NCQA is an independent nonprofit organization in the United States that works to improve health care quality through the administration of evidence-based standards, measures, programs, and accreditation. HEDIS includes over 90 clinical measures across six domains: effectiveness, access, experience, utilization, descriptive information, and electronic systems. HEDIS data is collected through surveys, medical charts and insurance claims for hospitalizations, medical office visits and procedures. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Health care plans seek accreditation and measure performance through the administration and submission of HEDIS data. Health care plans must undergo a HEDIS Compliance Audit, which may only be performed by licensed organizations and certified auditors. NCQA publishes the results of the measures on their website. HEDIS was designed to allow consumers to compare health care plan performance and for national and regional benchmarks.
                </p>

                <h5>What I did:</h5>
                <p>
                    On an annual basis NCQA adds, deletes, and revises the HEDIS measures. As a member of the backend healthcare analytics engine team, I was responsible for updating the codebase (C++) to implement new and revised measures. Afterwards, our Quality Assurance (QA) team would review the changes and ensure that the measures were implemented correctly. If any bugs or issues were found, I would work with the QA team to fix them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to HEDIS measures, I also worked on <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMS</a> measures. CMS measures are used to assure and evaluate quality health care for Medicare and Medicaid Beneficiaries. Furthermore, some states would have their own custom measures that we would need to implement and maintain.
                </p>

                
                <div class="text-container large-gap">
                    <p>
                       During my time at Centene, I became owner of a significant portion of our codebase that was left abandoned when a previous engineer left the company. This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the codebase and to become a more senior engineer. Specifically, it was our entire section of Risk Adjusted measures that was left destitute. NCQA uses risk-adjusted measures in HEDIS to assess health plan performance by accounting for differences in patient populations. These measures compare a plan's actual performance to an expected performance, factoring in variables like age, gender, and comorbidities. This allows for a more fair comparison between plans, as it adjusts for the inherent risks associated with different patient profiles. I was able to refactor these measures and bring them up to date with the latest standards of our codebase, restoring the lost functionality of these measures.

                <p>
                    SSDS is the command and control system aboard amphibious ships and aircraft carriers. The Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS) is a combat system specifically designed for anti-air defense of aircraft carriers. Navy commanders depend on SSDS to effectively integrate their ship’s sensors and weapon systems to enable the timely engagement of a diverse spectrum of hostile air threats to their ship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The SSDS program runs on a ten year contract basis. At the time of my employment, the program was under <a href="https://www.rtx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raytheon</a> (now known as RTX Corporation). My co-workers and I worked as sub-contractors for Raytheon alongside their employees to develop and maintain the software for the SSDS program.

                        As a software engineer, I contributed to all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle: planning, design, software development, testing, and maintenance. I developed code (C++) for the SSDS program on a Linux platform. While working on the project we used an Agile/Scrum development process.

                <h2>Cryptocurrency Trading Bot</h2>

                <!-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_Self-Defense_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSDS?</a> -->

                <p>
                    During the summer of 2022, I became extremely intrigued with the stock market and how to trade stocks. I dove deep into learning about investing and trading. I learned about Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, and the investing philosophies of legendary investors such as Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Peter Lynch. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investopedia</a> quickly became one of my favorite websites!
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a software engineer, I wanted to incorporate my skills in software development with my newfound interest in stock trading. That was when I decided I wanted to challenge myself to build a trading bot. 
                </p>

                <h5>What is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Analysis?</a></h5>

                <p>
                    When it comes to stock market trading and investing there are two main schools of thought: Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis. Fundamental Analysis is the study of a company's financial statements, earnings, and other metrics to determine the fair value of their stock. This is the chief investing principle used by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Fundamental analysts search for stocks trading at prices higher or lower than their real value. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Technical Analysis on the other hand is the study of a stock's price and volume data to predict future price movements in order to identify trading and investment opportunities. Technical analysts pretty much solely focus on analyzing stock charts to find patterns and trends that can then be used to make trading decisions. Unlike Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis is not concerned with the underlying fundamentals of a company. One of the main tools used by technical analysts are <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Indicators</a>.
                </p>

                <h5>Technical Indicators</h5>
                <p>
                    Technical indicators are mathematical heuristics and patterns based on the price and volume data of a stock. They use formulas and algorithms to derive meaningful insights from price action data. The most popular and commonly used technical indicators include MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages. A fascinating property about technical indicators is that since they are math based, they work not just on stocks but on any asset that has price and volume data (including cryptocurrencies). In fact, they probably work better on cryptocurrencies than traditional stocks! 
                </p>

                <div class="image-container">

                    </a>
                </div>
                
                <h5>Why cryptocurrency?</h5>

                <p>
                    So far I've mainly only mentioned the stock market. So why did I choose to build a trading bot for cryptocurrency? Well, there are a couple of reasons. One main reason is, since trading bots are computer programs, they have to rely on an algorithmic data based approach to trading which is why they primarily use technical indicators for their trading logic. As I mentioned earlier, technical indicators work great on cryptocurrencies. A second reason is, I wanted to challenge myself to build a trading bot for a new future-looking asset class. A huge benefit of trading cryptocurrencies is the fact that they are digital and can be traded anytime 24/7 unlike traditional stocks which are traded on a fixed schedule (business days from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST). However, because technical indicators work on any asset that has price and volume, my bot's trading logic could be modified to trade traditional stocks.

                <h5>Freqtrade</h5>
                <p>
                    When I started researching trading bots, I quickly discovered <a href="https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade" target="_blank">Freqtrade</a>. Freqtrade is a free and open-source Python based cryptocurrency trading bot framework. Freqtrade works on the main cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase. It allows you to download historical price and volume data for any cryptocurrency pair supported by the exchange. With this data, you can backtest your trading strategy and optimize your trading parameters. Backtesting is where Freqtrade runs a simulation of your trading strategy on historical data and presents you with the results of your strategy. Then once you're satisfied with your strategy, you can use Freqtrade to trade the cryptocurrency live in real time.

                    </a>
                </div> 

                <p>
                    After reading the Freqtrade documentation, I started working on developing and implementing my own trading strategy. I studied and learned several technical indicators and tested how I could use them to create a profitable strategy. Thanks to backtesting, I could test my strategy on historical data and optimize my strategy. I became obsessed with finding the optimal strategy and spent countless hours continuously learning, testing, and improving my strategy. It was extremely fun and rewarding finding ways to make my strategy more and more profitable!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, I was able to find a strategy that I was satisfied with. Let's take a look at the results!

                <p>
                    In case you're wondering what all of these terms mean, here are some of their definitions so we have a better understanding of the results.
                </p>

                <h5>Definitions:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>CAGR:</h4>
                        The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a financial metric that measures the annual growth rate of an investment or portfolio over a specified period, assuming the returns are reinvested (compounded) each year. It provides a smoothed, annualized return that reflects the growth as if it occurred at a steady rate, making it useful for comparing the performance of different investments or strategies. It’s ideal for summarizing long-term performance. The S&P 500 has a historical CAGR of ~10% per year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Sortino:</h4>
                        The Sortino ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of an investment or trading strategy, similar to the Sharpe ratio, but with a key difference: it focuses only on downside risk (negative returns or losses) rather than total volatility. This makes it particularly relevant for highlighting how well a strategy manages unfavorable outcomes, which is critical in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. A higher Sortino ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns relative to downside risk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Sharpe:</h4>
                        The Sharpe ratio is a financial metric used to measure the risk-adjusted return of an investment or trading strategy. It shows how much return an investment generates per unit of risk taken, helping compare strategies or portfolios by accounting for volatility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Calmar:</h4>
                        The Calmar ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of an investment or trading strategy by comparing its annualized return to its maximum drawdown (the largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value). It highlights how well a strategy delivers returns relative to the worst-case loss. A higher Calmar ratio indicates better returns per unit of maximum loss.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>SQN:</h4>
                        The SQN (System Quality Number) is a performance metric developed by Dr. Van K. Tharp to evaluate the quality of a trading system or strategy by measuring the consistency and profitability of its returns relative to the variability of those returns. SQN evaluates how predictable and reliable a trading system’s returns are. A high SQN indicates consistent profits with low variability. Negative SQN values suggest a losing strategy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Profit Factor:</h4>
                        The Profit Factor is a performance metric that measures the efficiency of a trading strategy by comparing the total gross profits from winning trades to the total gross losses from losing trades. It indicates how many times the profits cover the losses, providing a clear view of the strategy’s ability to generate gains relative to its risks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Expectancy (ratio):</h4>
                        The Expectancy Ratio is a metric that measures the average expected profit per trade relative to the risk taken in each trade, expressed as a multiple of the risk (often denoted as "R"). It’s derived from the Expectancy, which quantifies the average dollar amount you expect to gain (or lose) per trade based on your strategy’s win rate, average win, and average loss. The Expectancy Ratio provides a normalized view of profitability per unit of risk, making it useful for evaluating the efficiency of a trading strategy. A high ratio indicates effective risk management, as losses are minimized while gains are maximized.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Backtesting Period:</h5>
                <p>
                    At the time of this writing, I backtested my strategy on BTC (Bitcoin) from the dates of January 1st, 2021 to March 25th, 2025. Why did I start the backtesting since January 2021 when Bitcoin has been around since 2009? The exchange I'm using only provides historical data for Bitcoin starting from 2019-09-23. Furthermore, the technical indicators I use require a certain amount of data to start producing their signals. Thus, I chose January 2021 as the start date of my backtesting period.
                </p>

                <h5>Results Overview:</h5>
                <p>
                    I set the bot to start with a trading balance of $10,000 USDT which is a cryptocurrency stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar (the exchange I'm using doesn't support normal USD). Looking at the results you can see my trading strategy ended with a balance of $74,781 USDT over a period of about 3 years resulting in a total profit of $64,781 USDT. That's a 647% return on investment!
                </p>


                <div class="text-container large-gap">
                    <p>
                        My strategy had a CAGR of 60.90% which significantly outperforms the S&P 500's historical CAGR of ~10% per year. Another highlight is the 2.06 Sortino ratio and 6.92 Calmar ratio which shows that my strategy is able to generate high returns with robust downside risk management. Another highlight is the 2.06 Sortino ratio and 6.92 Calmar ratio which shows that my strategy is able to generate high returns with robust downside risk management. Additionally, the profit factor of 38.21 and an expectancy ratio of 7.44, demonstrate both profitable and efficient risk-adjusted returns.
