                    <p>
                        From the fall of 2013 to the spring of 2017 I attended the University of California, San Diego where I
                        learned to program and the marvelous art of Software Engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time at UCSD, I learned everything from object-oriented programming and software design patterns to data structures and algorithms. I did the majority of my class work in Java, C++, and Python which are my main languages. During my time as a student I also worked as a tutor for the UCSD CSE department for several quarters. I tutored both lower and upper division data structure courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A huge part of my time at UCSD was being accepted into the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) by the CSE department. I applied to the program the first year it was created and was one of 23 undergraduate students accepted into the program. The main purpose of the program was to expose and get undergraduate students involved in Computer Science Research which is typically done by graduate students and professors. As a result of the ERSP program, I spent three years working alongside graduate students and professors on their research projects in the <a href="https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/" target="_blank">Systems and Networking Research Group</a>. You can read more about the program <a href="https://ersp.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h5>What are <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEDIS</a> measures?</h5>
                <p>
                    HEDIS measures are a set of standardized metrics used to evaluate the quality of healthcare services. They are used by healthcare organizations to monitor and improve the quality of care they provide. It's a gold standard in healthcare performance measurement, used by over 90% of health plans in the US.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HEDIS measures are created and managed by the <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Committee for Quality Assurance</a> (NCQA). NCQA is an independent nonprofit organization in the United States that works to improve health care quality through the administration of evidence-based standards, measures, programs, and accreditation. HEDIS includes over 90 clinical measures across six domains: effectiveness, access, experience, utilization, descriptive information, and electronic systems. HEDIS data is collected through surveys, medical charts and insurance claims for hospitalizations, medical office visits and procedures. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Health care plans seek accreditation and measure performance through the administration and submission of HEDIS data. Health care plans must undergo a HEDIS Compliance Audit, which may only be performed by licensed organizations and certified auditors. NCQA publishes the results of the measures on their website. HEDIS was designed to allow consumers to compare health care plan performance and for national and regional benchmarks.
                </p>

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <h5>Example HEDIS Measures</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lead Screening in Children (LSC): The percentage of children 2 years of age who had one or more capillary or venous lead blood test for lead poisoning by their second birthday.</li>
                    <li>Breast Cancer Screening (BCS): assesses women 50–74 years of age who had at least one mammogram to screen for breast cancer in the past two years.</li>
                    <li>Annual Dental Visit (ADV): Assesses Medicaid members 2–20 years of age with dental benefits, who had at least one dental visit during the year.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Backend Engine Overview</h5>
                <p>
                    To calculate the scores for HEDIS measures, we used our backend engine which was built in C++. You would give the engine a list of measures and a set of members from a certain population data set. Then, for each member, the engine would iterate over all of their health-care data from our database (e.g. medical charts, insurance claims, medical office visits, and procedures). Next, it would run all of their data through the list of specified measures and depending on the measure give them a pass/fail score. Some measures would output a numerical score based on certain criteria and calculations. Lastly, we would output all of the results in a JSON format which was then consumed and analyzed by our API team.
                </p>

                <h5>What I did:</h5>
                <p>
                    On an annual basis NCQA adds, deletes, and revises the HEDIS measures. As a member of the backend healthcare analytics engine team, I was responsible for updating the codebase (C++) to implement new and revised measures. Afterwards, our Quality Assurance (QA) team would review the changes and ensure that the measures were implemented correctly. If any bugs or issues were found, I would work with the QA team to fix them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every year NCQA published a large Technical Specifications document that contained all of the HEDIS measures and their specifications. This document was used as a reference for implementing the measures in our codebase. My task would be to read through the document and write code (C++) to implement the measures according to their specifications. Above is an image showing a simplified example of what the Technical Specifications document looked like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to HEDIS measures, I also worked on <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMS</a> measures. CMS measures are used to assure and evaluate quality health care for Medicare and Medicaid Beneficiaries. Furthermore, some states would have their own custom measures that we would need to implement and maintain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An example of a project I worked on was to refactor our core engine's output. I worked with one of the VPs who wanted more insight into how our scores for measures were being calculated. Specifically, he wanted to know exactly which health-care codes were being used to evaluate our scores. Thus I had to refactor our engine's code to store and output a list of all health-care codes that were used to compute the scores for each member.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another project I worked on was to create a tool that would convert all of our health-care data for members from a plain text format to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YAML</a> format. My manager was a big fan of YAML and he wanted to update the codebase to use it. Thus, I developed a C++ program that would read in our plain text data, convert it to YAML, and output it in the new format. Once I finished the program, I successfully ran it and converted all of our data into YAML.

                    Our team used <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confluence</a> to create and maintain our technical documentation. In my downtime, I wrote and contributed a copious amount of documentation to our Confluence pages. This documentation helped our team and future engineers understand the codebase and the logic behind the code.

                        During my time at Centene, I became owner of a significant portion of our codebase that was left abandoned when a previous engineer left the company. This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the codebase and to become a more senior engineer. Specifically, it was our entire section of Risk Adjusted measures that was left destitute. NCQA uses risk-adjusted measures in HEDIS to assess health plan performance by accounting for differences in patient populations. These measures compare a plan's actual performance to an expected performance, factoring in variables like age, gender, and comorbidities. This allows for a more fair comparison between plans, as it adjusts for the inherent risks associated with different patient profiles. I was able to refactor these measures and bring them up to date with the latest standards of our codebase, restoring the lost functionality of these measures.

                <p>
                    SSDS is the command and control system aboard amphibious ships and aircraft carriers. The Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS) is a combat system specifically designed for anti-air defense of aircraft carriers. Navy commanders depend on SSDS to effectively integrate their ship’s sensors and weapon systems to enable the timely engagement of a diverse spectrum of hostile air threats to their ship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The SSDS program runs on a ten year contract basis. At the time of my employment, the program was under <a href="https://www.rtx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raytheon</a> (now known as RTX Corporation). My co-workers and I worked as sub-contractors for Raytheon alongside their employees to develop and maintain the software for the SSDS program.

                <h2>Cryptocurrency Trading Bot</h2>

                <!-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_Self-Defense_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSDS?</a> -->

                <p>
                    During the summer of 2022, I became extremely intrigued with the stock market and how to trade stocks. I dove deep into learning about investing and trading. I learned about Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, and the investing philosophies of legendary investors such as Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Peter Lynch. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investopedia</a> quickly became one of my favorite websites!
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a software engineer, I wanted to incorporate my skills in software development with my newfound interest in stock trading. That was when I decided I wanted to challenge myself to build a trading bot. 
                </p>

                <h5>What is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Analysis?</a></h5>

                <p>
                    When it comes to stock market trading and investing there are two main schools of thought: Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis. Fundamental Analysis is the study of a company's financial statements, earnings, and other metrics to determine the fair value of their stock. This is the chief investing principle used by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Fundamental analysts search for stocks trading at prices higher or lower than their real value. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Technical Analysis on the other hand is the study of a stock's price and volume data to predict future price movements in order to identify trading and investment opportunities. Technical analysts pretty much solely focus on analyzing stock charts to find patterns and trends that can then be used to make trading decisions. Unlike Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis is not concerned with the underlying fundamentals of a company. One of the main tools used by technical analysts are <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Indicators</a>.
                </p>

                <h5>Technical Indicators</h5>
                <p>
                    Technical indicators are mathematical heuristics and patterns based on the price and volume data of a stock. They use formulas and algorithms to derive meaningful insights from price action data. The most popular and commonly used technical indicators include MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages. A fascinating property about technical indicators is that since they are math based, they work not just on stocks but on any asset that has price and volume data (including cryptocurrencies). In fact, they probably work better on cryptocurrencies than traditional stocks! 
                </p>

                </div>
                
                <h5>Why cryptocurrency?</h5>

                <p>
                    So far I've mainly only mentioned the stock market. So why did I choose to build a trading bot for cryptocurrency? Well, there are a couple of reasons. One main reason is, since trading bots are computer programs, they have to rely on an algorithmic data based approach to trading which is why they primarily use technical indicators for their trading logic. As I mentioned earlier, technical indicators work great on cryptocurrencies. A second reason is, I wanted to challenge myself to build a trading bot for a new future-looking asset class. A huge benefit of trading cryptocurrencies is the fact that they are digital and can be traded anytime 24/7 unlike traditional stocks which are traded on a fixed schedule (business days from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST). However, because technical indicators work on any asset that has price and volume, my bot's trading logic could be modified to trade traditional stocks.

                <h5>Freqtrade</h5>
                <p>
                    When I started researching trading bots, I quickly discovered <a href="https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade" target="_blank">Freqtrade</a>. Freqtrade is a free and open-source Python based cryptocurrency trading bot framework. Freqtrade works on the main cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase. It allows you to download historical price and volume data for any cryptocurrency pair supported by the exchange. With this data, you can backtest your trading strategy and optimize your trading parameters. Backtesting is where Freqtrade runs a simulation of your trading strategy on historical data and presents you with the results of your strategy. Then once you're satisfied with your strategy, you can use Freqtrade to trade the cryptocurrency live in real time.

                </div> 

                <p>
                    After reading the Freqtrade documentation, I started working on developing and implementing my own trading strategy. I studied and learned several technical indicators and tested how I could use them to create a profitable strategy. Thanks to backtesting, I could test my strategy on historical data and optimize my strategy. I became obsessed with finding the optimal strategy and spent countless hours continuously learning, testing, and improving my strategy. It was extremely fun and rewarding finding ways to make my strategy more and more profitable!

                </div> 

                <h5>Example Freqtrade Strategy</h5>
                <p>
                    Let's take a look at what a simple Freqtrade strategy looks like. In the image above, you can see the code for a minimal strategy. For background information, Freqtrade uses <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pandas</a> to store and provide the candlestick data. Pandas is a great library developed for processing large amounts of data in tabular format. Each row in a dataframe corresponds to one candle on a chart and is made up of a six values: date, open, high, low, close and volume. The latest complete candle is always the last in the dataframe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we were to look at the first few rows of the main dataframe using the pandas <code>head()</code> function, we would see:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
    > dataframe.head()
                           date      open      high       low     close     volume
    0 2021-11-09 23:25:00+00:00  67279.67  67321.84  67255.01  67300.97   44.62253

    2 2021-11-09 23:35:00+00:00  67187.02  67187.02  67031.93  67123.81  113.42728
    3 2021-11-09 23:40:00+00:00  67123.80  67222.40  67080.33  67160.48   78.96008
    4 2021-11-09 23:45:00+00:00  67160.48  67160.48  66901.26  66943.37  111.39292
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The timeframe variable determines what candle length the strategy will use (e.g. 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d etc.). Some people use short timeframes such as 15m or 1h while others use longer timeframes, for instance 8h or 1d.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    On line 10 we set the stoploss for the strategy to be -10%. The stoploss parameter is a ratio that should trigger a sale. For example, the value -0.10 will cause an immediate sell if your profit dips below -10% for a given trade. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On line 13 setting the minimal_roi value to 0.01 means that the strategy will only sell a position if the profit is at least 1% above the initial entry price.
                </p>

                
                <p>
                    The <code>populate_indicators</code> function adds columns to the dataframe that represent the technical analysis indicator values. Technical analysis functions analyze the candle data using the technical indicator of your choice and then we can store the result in a new column in the dataframe. In line 18 we use ta-lib's RSI function <code>ta.RSI()</code>, and assign the result to a column named <code>rsi</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSI</a> is a very popular technical indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of price movements to detect overbought or oversold conditions. RSI values range from 0 to 100. A value above 70 is considered overbought while a value below 30 is considered oversold.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The purpose of the <code>populate_entry_trend</code> function is to define conditions for an entry signal (i.e. when to buy). We accomplish this by assigning a value of 1 to the dataframe column <code>enter_long</code> when the conditions we are looking for are met. The term <em>long</em> means to buy a cryptocurrency and aim to sell it at a higher price for a profit. When freqtrade encounters an entry signal, it will attempt to make a buy order. In the example code above, we assign a long entry signal whenever the RSI value is below 30.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similarly, the <code>populate_exit_trend</code> function defines conditions for an exit signal (i.e. when to sell). In the sample strategy, we look to exit our trade whenever the RSI value is above 70 which typically indicates that the price of the cryptocurrency is overbought and it's time to sell.
                </p>

                <h5>Machine Learning Optimization</h5>
                <p>
                    Freqtrade has a feature that allows you to optimize your strategy using machine learning, a process called Hyperparameter Optimization. First, you need to define a search space for the parameters you want to optimize. You can choose to optimize your buy, sell, stoploss, or other parameters. Second, you need to specify a range of values for each parameter. For example, if you want to test if your strategy performs better with a stoploss of 10% or 20%, you would specify a range of 10%-20% for the stoploss parameter. Once you have all of your parameters and their ranges defined, you can run the optimization process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The optimization process is a trial and error process where the bot will try different parameters and see which ones have the best performance. In general, the search for best parameters starts with a few random combinations and then uses Bayesian search with a ML regressor algorithm to quickly find a combination of parameters that perform the best. Depending on the size of your search space, the optimization process can take a while to complete. Afterwards, the program will output the best parameters it found and the results of the optimized strategy.
                </p>

                        <h4>CAGR:</h4>
                        The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a financial metric that measures the annual growth rate of an investment or portfolio over a specified period, assuming the returns are reinvested (compounded) each year. It provides a smoothed, annualized return that reflects the growth as if it occurred at a steady rate, making it useful for comparing the performance of different investments or strategies. It’s ideal for summarizing long-term performance. The S&P 500 has a historical CAGR of ~10% per year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Sortino:</h4>
                        The Sortino ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of an investment or trading strategy, similar to the Sharpe ratio, but with a key difference: it focuses only on downside risk (negative returns or losses) rather than total volatility. This makes it particularly relevant for highlighting how well a strategy manages unfavorable outcomes, which is critical in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. A higher Sortino ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns relative to downside risk.

                        The Sharpe ratio is a financial metric used to measure the risk-adjusted return of an investment or trading strategy. It shows how much return an investment generates per unit of risk taken, helping compare strategies or portfolios by accounting for volatility.

                        <h4>Calmar:</h4>
                        The Calmar ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of an investment or trading strategy by comparing its annualized return to its maximum drawdown (the largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value). It highlights how well a strategy delivers returns relative to the worst-case loss. A higher Calmar ratio indicates better returns per unit of maximum loss.

                    <li>
                        <h4>SQN:</h4>
                        The SQN (System Quality Number) is a performance metric developed by Dr. Van K. Tharp to evaluate the quality of a trading system or strategy by measuring the consistency and profitability of its returns relative to the variability of those returns. SQN evaluates how predictable and reliable a trading system’s returns are. A high SQN indicates consistent profits with low variability. Negative SQN values suggest a losing strategy.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Profit Factor:</h4>
                        The Profit Factor is a performance metric that measures the efficiency of a trading strategy by comparing the total gross profits from winning trades to the total gross losses from losing trades. It indicates how many times the profits cover the losses, providing a clear view of the strategy’s ability to generate gains relative to its risks.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Expectancy (ratio):</h4>
                        The Expectancy Ratio is a metric that measures the average expected profit per trade relative to the risk taken in each trade, expressed as a multiple of the risk (often denoted as "R"). It’s derived from the Expectancy, which quantifies the average dollar amount you expect to gain (or lose) per trade based on your strategy’s win rate, average win, and average loss. The Expectancy Ratio provides a normalized view of profitability per unit of risk, making it useful for evaluating the efficiency of a trading strategy. A high ratio indicates effective risk management, as losses are minimized while gains are maximized.

                </ul>

                <h5>Backtesting Period:</h5>
                <p>
                    At the time of this writing, I backtested my strategy on BTC (Bitcoin) from the dates of January 1st, 2021 to March 25th, 2025. Why did I start the backtesting since January 2021 when Bitcoin has been around since 2009? The exchange I'm using only provides historical data for Bitcoin starting from 2019-09-23. Furthermore, the technical indicators I use require a certain amount of data to start producing their signals. Thus, I chose January 2021 as the start date of my backtesting period.
                </p>

                <h5>Results Overview:</h5>
                <p>
                    I set the bot to start with a trading balance of $10,000 USDT which is a cryptocurrency stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar (the exchange I'm using doesn't support normal USD). Looking at the results you can see my trading strategy ended with a balance of $74,781 over a period of about 4 years resulting in a total profit of $64,781. That's a 647% return on investment!
                </p>


                <div class="text-container large-gap">
                    <p>
                        My strategy had a CAGR of 60.90% which significantly outperforms the S&P 500's historical CAGR of ~10% per year. Another highlight is the 2.06 Sortino ratio and 6.92 Calmar ratio which shows that my strategy is able to generate high returns with robust downside risk management. Additionally, the profit factor of 38.21 and an expectancy ratio of 7.44, demonstrate both profitable and efficient risk-adjusted returns.

                <h2>PS5 Purchasing Bot</h2>

                <p>
                    2020 was an interesting year to say the least. The COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing and the world was in a state of uncertainty. In particular, the pandemic caused a global shortage of semiconductors which affected the production of many products, including the PlayStation 5.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The long awaited PlayStation 5 (PS5) launched on November 12, 2020. The launch was highly anticipated but unfortunately, the launch was faced with unprecedented challenges due to global supply chain disruptions and high demand from gamers. This combination of unfortunate circumstances led to massive widespread stock shortages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Scalpers and resellers quickly took advantage of the situation and started buying up all of the available PS5s using bots and sold them for huge profits on eBay and other platforms. For example, the PS5 launched with a retail price of $499.99 but scalpers were selling them for over $1,000!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The limited supply of PS5s and the actions of scalpers made it nearly impossible for the average gamer to simply purchase a PS5. Several of my friends were victims of this unfortunate situation and were unable to purchase a PS5 for themselves.
                </p>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./images/ps5_scalpers.webp" alt="PS5 listings on eBay" onclick="openFullscreen(this)" class="clickable-image">
                        <figcaption>PS5 listings on eBay by scalpers</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Knowing that I am a software engineer, my friends asked me if I knew of any possible solution to this mess of a situation. This led me to researching the problem and I came across a small community of people who were developing their own bot to purchase PS5s. To quote the GitHub repo: 
                </p>

                <blockquote cite="https://github.com/Strip3s/PhoenixBot">
                    "Phoenix Bot is inspired by Natewong1313's Bird Bot project yet due to lack of activity by their team. We have decided to revive this project to achieve a common goal. Due to the recent insurgence of botters/scalpers taking advantage, our goal is to enable everyone the ability to combat these botters/scalpers by implementing their own botting system."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    I was intrigued by the project so I joined their Discord server and quickly became a contributor to the project. Members of the community ranged from normal gamers to people learning to code as well as some experienced software engineers. We were a group of complete strangers but yet we came together to solve a common problem we all had - <u><em>how to purchase a PS5.</em></u> 
                </p>


                <div class="image-container">
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The codebase was written in Python and used PyQt5 for the UI. Above is an image of the user interface. Now as a reminder, the PS5 was launched in November which meant there was a huge amount of pressure to purchase one before the holidays. Parents wanted to buy one for their kids and some simply wanted to purchase one for themselves. Consequently, the entire community was extremely motivated and determined to achieve success with our Phoenix Bot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Together as a group, we all contributed our knowledge and expertise. Luckily, some of us were educated in software development and website design. The lead developer of the project was a software engineer who was quite knowledgeable about web development and APIs. We quickly split up the work and each of us applied our skills to different parts of the project. Some worked on the UI, some worked on the purchasing logic, and some provided information about when which websites were planning to release stock online.
                </p>
                

                <h5>Main Development Tasks:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Program the bot to navigate to a website and find the PS5 product page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monitor the product page for stock availability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the product became in stock, add it to the cart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go through the complete checkout process and fill out all forms on the way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Handle any unexpected errors or interruptions that may occur.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fill out the payment information and successfully complete the purchase!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="image-container">

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    We focused on developing the bot to work on the main online retailers since they were likely to have the most available stock. The main sites we worked on were Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart. I took on the task of engineering the bot to work on GameStop and Target.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On nights and weekends, I was dedicated to working on the bot. We had to make the bot fast, we had to make it reliable, we had to make it efficient, and most importantly, <u><em>we had to make it work.</em></u>  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Step by step we started implementing key functionality of the bot. Day by day we became closer and closer to achieving our shared goal. During the development process, PS5s would be released online and some of us would try to purchase one manually themselves. Unfortunately, scalpers and their bots were still running rampant making it nearly impossible to be triumphant. Some members of the community were able to purchase one manually but it was still a rare occurrence. Our goal of making it possible for all of us to successfully purchase a PS5 was still yet to be achieved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, we implemented the majority of the key features of the bot. We figured out how to program the bot to navigate websites, monitor product pages, add items to the cart, and fill out forms. It was a great feeling seeing the bot become more and more functional! It was awesome being able to run the bot and watch it work as it filled out forms and go through the checkout process. We made sure to do extensive testing because it was <em>critical</em> that the bot worked as expected when the time came to attempt to purchase a PS5.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, not everything went smoothly. Retailers started to add anti-bot measures to their websites to prevent scalpers from purchasing PS5s. This was a benefit to the average consumer but it made our job more difficult. Not only did we have to compete against bots by the scalpers but now we had to figure out how to bypass the retailers' anti-bot measures!
                </p>

                <p>
                    For instance, an easy way to detect a bot is to check how fast the user is navigating and interacting with the website. If the user is navigating the website too fast, it is likely a bot. To combat this, we added a random delay between the actions the bot takes to make it seem more human-like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally the time came where our bot was fully ready to be used. I finished implementing the bot to work on GameStop and Target. Now all that was left was to run the bot, wait for the PS5s to be released online, and hope everything worked as expected. We diligently researched when the retailers were planning to release stock online and kept up with latest rumors and news about PS5 availability. We would leave the bot running 24/7 and hoped for the best.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One night we had news Target was going to release stock sometime between 2:00am - 4:00am in the morning. Before I went to bed, I turned on the bot and set it to run on Target's website. In the morning when I woke up, I immediately jumped out of bed and rushed to my computer to see what had happened overnight. That was when I saw it, the final purchase confirmation screen of my very own PS5! The bot was a success!! All of our hard work and dedication finally paid off and I was able to enjoy the victory of my own hard work! It was a glorious moment and a moment I will always remember.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Day by day, more and more members of the community were successfully able to purchase a PS5 using our bot. It was a great feeling knowing that we were able to help so many people achieve their long awaited goal. Some members even shipped extra PS5s they bought to other members of the community to make sure as many of us as possible were able to get a PS5.

                        As time went on, thanks to our bot as well as PS5 availability becoming better, pretty much all of us were able to purchase a PS5. With our goal finally being achieved, we naturally no longer needed to work on the bot. Its purpose was accomplished and we were able to enjoy the fruits of our labor.
